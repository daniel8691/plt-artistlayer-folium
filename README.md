# plt-artistlayer-folium

A survey was conducted to gauge an audience interest in different data science topics, namely:

Big Data (Spark / Hadoop)
Data Analysis / Statistics
Data Journalism
Data Visualization
Deep Learning
Machine Learning
The participants had three options for each topic: Very Interested, Somewhat interested, and Not interested. 2,233 respondents completed the survey.

Use the artist layer of Matplotlib to replicate the bar chart below to visualize the percentage of the respondents' interest in the different data science topics surveyed.


To create this bar chart, you can follow the following steps:

Sort the dataframe in descending order of Very interested.
Convert the numbers into percentages of the total number of respondents. Recall that 2,233 respondents completed the survey. Round percentages to 2 decimal places.
As for the chart:
use a figure size of (20, 8),
bar width of 0.8,
use color #5cb85c for the Very interested bars, color #5bc0de for the Somewhat interested bars, and color #d9534f for the Not interested bars,
use font size 14 for the bar labels, percentages, and legend,
use font size 16 for the title, and,
display the percentages above the bars as shown above, and remove the left, top, and right borders.
